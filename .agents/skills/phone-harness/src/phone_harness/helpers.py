Core helpers live here. Agent-editable helpers live in

Everything below is a thin wrapper over send(), which is defined first on
purpose: the helpers are conveniences, not a wall. Drop to send() for anything
they don't cover, and below that to the backend itself — `import Quartz` on
iOS. The agent picks its own altitude.

Nothing in this file knows which platform it is driving. Platform differences
live inside one backend each, behind the ops documented in transport.py, so
`nav.home` and `screen.text` mean the same thing everywhere even though an
iPhone answers them with a Cmd+1 keystroke and Vision OCR.
