"""Background backend — drive iPhone Mirroring WITHOUT bringing it to the front.

The default (mirror.py) backend must make the iPhone Mirroring window frontmost
before every action: it captures with `screencapture` and injects with
`CGEventPost`, both of which target the focused app, so automation steals your
screen for its whole run.

This backend removes that. Two pieces, both proven to work with the window
unfocused and another app frontmost:

  EYES  - CGWindowListCreateImage captures a specific window by id even when it
          is not the active app (and even when occluded).

  HANDS - the input path macOS actually gates on is the app being *active*, not
          merely its window being key. A normal CGEvent can't cross that. But
          the window server accepts a synthesized event record delivered
          straight to a process via SkyLight's SLPSPostEventRecordTo (the same
          mechanism yabai uses to focus windows without raising them). Written
          with a real location, it lands a positioned tap/drag in iPhone
          Mirroring while your frontmost app never changes.

The event-record layout is yabai's (window_manager_make_key_window): a 0xf8
buffer, length at 0x04, CGSEventType at 0x08 (1=down, 2=up, 6=dragged),
location at 0x10 and windowLocation at 0x20 as CGPoints, window id at 0x3c.
yabai blanks the location to signal "focus"; we write the real point to make
it a click. Every write stays inside the buffer, so a wrong value is a no-op,
never a crash.

Select with PHONE_HARNESS_BACKGROUND=1. Coordinates use the same global
screen-point convention as the mirror backend and ocr(), so every helper on
top (tap_text, swipe, scroll_collect) works unchanged — just without focus.

Keyboard (type_text/press) still briefly activates the window: the keyboard
event-record layout isn't implemented yet, so those fall back to the mirror
path. Mouse actions are fully background.

    macOS routes a scroll event to the window under the REAL cursor, not to the

      - the old flick (down 0.72h, drag, up 0.28h) never scrolled at all: iOS
        read it as a TAP at the touch-down point and opened whatever row sat
        there. Silent, and destructive on a Home Screen or a chat list.
      - a wheel event posted with CGEventPostToPid does nothing, with or
        without the continuous/scroll-phase fields a real trackpad sets:
        posting to a pid bypasses the hit-testing that routes scrolls.
      - a SkyLight scroll record (CGSEventType 22) over the channel the mouse
        events use: nothing at any delta offset tried.
      - arrow keys, space and cmd+down over the working background key path:
        nothing; iOS lists don't scroll from those.
      - posting to the HID tap with only CGEventSetLocation set: nothing,
        because the cursor was elsewhere on screen.

    So put the cursor over the window for the length of the gesture and put it
    straight back. Mirroring does NOT need to be frontmost — verified scrolling
    with Finder active throughout. Warping costs the user their pointer for
    ~0.3s, which is a great deal cheaper than an activation, and immeasurably
